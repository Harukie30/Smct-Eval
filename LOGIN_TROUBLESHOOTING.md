# üîß Login Redirect Issue - Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem Description
User logs in successfully, console shows "Login successful" and "User role for redirect: employee", but then gets redirected back to the login page instead of the dashboard.

---

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

### 1. **Added Authentication State Wait Time**
- Added 500ms wait after login to ensure `UserContext` state is updated
- Added 300ms wait before redirect to ensure state propagation
- This fixes the race condition between login and `ProtectedRoute` check

### 2. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
The console will now show detailed information:

```javascript
üîç DEBUG - localStorage check: {
  hasStoredUser: true,
  storedUserData: { ... user data ... },
  keepLoggedIn: "true",
  isAuthenticated: true  // ‚Üê Check this value!
}
‚úÖ User role for redirect: employee
üöÄ Redirecting to: /employee-dashboard
‚è≥ Waiting for authentication state to propagate...
üîÑ Executing redirect now...
```

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- Now shows clear error messages if role is invalid
- Shows localStorage keys if user data not found
- Stops loading screen if errors occur

## üêõ If Issue Still Persists - Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Console Logs
Open browser console (F12) and look for these messages:

1. **‚úÖ Login successful** - Login function worked
2. **üîç DEBUG - localStorage check** - Shows auth state
3. **‚úÖ User role for redirect** - Shows detected role
4. **üöÄ Redirecting to:** - Shows target dashboard
5. **‚è≥ Waiting for authentication state** - Propagation wait
6. **üîÑ Executing redirect now** - Redirect executed

**If you don't see all these messages**, note which one is missing!

### Step 2: Check localStorage
In browser console, run:

```javascript
// Check if user is stored
console.log(localStorage.getItem('authenticatedUser'));

// Check remember me setting
console.log(localStorage.getItem('keepLoggedIn'));

// Check all keys
console.log(Object.keys(localStorage));
```

**Expected output:**
- `authenticatedUser` should have user data (JSON string)
- `keepLoggedIn` should be `"true"`
- Should see multiple keys like `accounts`, `submissions`, etc.

### Step 3: Check Browser Settings

**üîç localStorage Might Be Blocked!**

1. **Chrome/Edge:**
   - Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Privacy and security` ‚Üí `Cookies and other site data`
   - Make sure "Block third-party cookies" is **OFF** or add exception for `localhost`

2. **Firefox:**
   - Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Privacy & Security`
   - Set "Enhanced Tracking Protection" to **Standard** (not Strict)

3. **Try Incognito/Private Mode:**
   - If it works in incognito but not regular mode, **it's a browser cache/settings issue**

### Step 4: Clear Everything and Try Again

**Option 1: Use the Built-in Button**
- Scroll to bottom of login page
- Click "üîÑ Clear Session & Start Fresh" button
- Try logging in again

**Option 2: Manual Clear (Console)**
```javascript
// Run this in browser console
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### Step 5: Try Different Browser
- If it works in Chrome but not Firefox (or vice versa), **it's a browser-specific issue**
- Recommended browsers: Chrome, Edge (Chromium-based)

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Session error. Please try logging in again"
**Cause:** localStorage not saving user data  
**Solution:**
1. Check browser localStorage settings (see Step 3)
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Try different browser

### Issue 2: Infinite Redirect Loop
**Cause:** ProtectedRoute keeps failing authentication  
**Solution:**
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Reload page
3. Check console for error messages

### Issue 3: "Invalid user role. Please contact support"
**Cause:** User account has invalid/missing role  
**Solution:**
1. Check `accounts.json` file
2. Make sure user has valid role: `employee`, `admin`, `hr`, `evaluator`, `manager`
3. Make sure role is lowercase

### Issue 4: Redirects to Wrong Dashboard
**Cause:** Role mapping incorrect  
**Solution:**
Check role in console and verify mapping:
- `admin` ‚Üí `/admin`
- `hr` ‚Üí `/hr-dashboard`
- `evaluator` ‚Üí `/evaluator`
- `employee` ‚Üí `/employee-dashboard`
- `manager` ‚Üí `/evaluator`

## üî• Emergency Fix (If Nothing Works)

If all else fails, try this temporary workaround:

1. Login will fail
2. Manually navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/employee-dashboard`
3. You should be logged in from localStorage
4. If this works but auto-redirect doesn't, **it's definitely a redirect timing issue**

Then contact the frontend dev with:
- Browser name and version
- Console logs (full output)
- localStorage contents
- Any error messages

## üìù Testing Credentials

Use these test accounts:

| Username | Password | Role | Dashboard |
|----------|----------|------|-----------|
| john.doe@example.com | password123 | employee | /employee-dashboard |
| admin@example.com | admin123 | admin | /admin |
| evaluator@example.com | eval123 | evaluator | /evaluator |

## üí° Tips for Backend Developer

1. **Always check console first** - Most issues show up there
2. **Try "Clear Session" button** - Solves 80% of issues
3. **Use Chrome DevTools** - F12 ‚Üí Console, Network, Application tabs
4. **Check Network tab** - See if any API calls are failing
5. **localStorage must work** - This app relies heavily on it

---

## ‚úÖ How to Know It's Fixed

After login, you should:
1. See loading screen (2-3 seconds)
2. See success toast notification
3. Automatically redirect to dashboard
4. **NOT** see the login page again

If you see the login page after "Login successful", something is still wrong!

---

## üÜò Still Not Working?

Contact frontend developer with:
1. **Browser:** Chrome/Firefox/Edge + Version
2. **Console logs:** (Copy entire console output)
3. **localStorage data:** `console.log(localStorage)`
4. **Network tab:** Any failed requests
5. **Screenshots:** Of the issue

## üìö Technical Details (For Developers)

### Authentication Flow:
1. User submits credentials
2. `login()` function called in UserContext
3. User data saved to:
   - React state (`user`, `profile`)
   - localStorage (`authenticatedUser`, `keepLoggedIn`)
4. **WAIT 500ms** for state propagation
5. Redirect to dashboard
6. **WAIT 300ms** before actual navigation
7. Dashboard loads
8. `ProtectedRoute` checks `isAuthenticated`
9. If true: Show dashboard
10. If false: Redirect to login

### Race Condition:
- **Problem:** Step 8 happens before Step 3 completes
- **Solution:** Added wait times (500ms + 300ms)
- **Why it matters:** React state updates are asynchronous

### Files Involved:
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Login page & redirect logic
- `src/contexts/UserContext.tsx` - Authentication state
- `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Auth guard
- `src/app/employee-dashboard/page.tsx` - Protected dashboard
